# Local Domains

Local Domains is a simple BASH script for creating local domains on Debian and Debian-based distributions.

# Versioning Scheme

I use a 3-digit version identifier, for example 1.0.1. These digits have the following meaning:

* The first digit (1) specifies the major version number.
* The second digit (0) specifies the minor version number.
* The third digit (1) specifies the patch version number.
